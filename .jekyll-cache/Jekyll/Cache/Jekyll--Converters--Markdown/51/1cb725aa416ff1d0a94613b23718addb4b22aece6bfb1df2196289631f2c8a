I"O<p>I would like to get accurate offers that make sense to my profile. To help you with that please read those working styles:</p>

<h2 id="0-common-contract">0. Common contract</h2>
<p>I am still interested in them but they have lower priority.</p>

<h2 id="i-intensive-short-contract">I. Intensive short contract</h2>
<p>100% On-site. Very intensive and very well paid contract. It can be anywhere on the globe. If I am busy mention this style at the first contact attempt.</p>

<h2 id="ii-very-intensive-3-weeks--1-week-off">II. Very intensive 3 weeks &amp; 1 week off</h2>
<p>100% On-site. Preferred longer contracts. No remote work required. My favourite style. Posible permanent roles.</p>

<p>For three weeks I am close to your workplace. I do everything needed. I come early and end late. If possible I work during the 6-th day. All this overtime I accumulate to have “a paid like week off”. I also need a break during the day to remain creative (no longer than 30 min. without any interaction).</p>

<ul>
  <li>If there would not be enough over-hours I would accept unpaid days off (3 at maximum per month).</li>
  <li>If it is easier to count then instead of paid days off I agree to a higher daily rate with unpaid week allowance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iii-partial-remote-work">III. Partial remote work</h2>
<p>1-3 weeks on-site, rest remotely. Posible permanent roles.</p>

<h2 id="iv-remote-work-at-full-time">IV. Remote work at full-time</h2>
<p>Like it is commonly known.</p>

<h2 id="any-mix-of-above-styles">Any mix of above styles</h2>

<h2 id="my-commitment">My commitment:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>During the days off I obligate to be available in case my context would be needed. I will check the messages and to advice if needed.</li>
  <li>For the possibility of remote intervention, I need to schedule it to have my full equipment close to me.</li>
</ul>
