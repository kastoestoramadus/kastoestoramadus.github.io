<h1 id="how-long-is-your-support-on-your-phone">How long is your support on your phone?</h1>
<p>Why I even ask? Do you know that the easiest way to hack your device is just to use already well-known exploits? Each update exposes backdoors to your phone! Hacking an updated system is just too expensive for a regular hacker.</p>

<h1 id="so-how-long-is-your-support-on-your-tablet">So… how long is your support on your tablet?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>cheap androids - not supported at all</li>
  <li>next level androids - 1-year</li>
  <li>premium Android smartphones - 2 years</li>
  <li>Google Android smartphones (and some Premium ones with security only patches) - 3 years</li>
  <li>iPhone/iPad - 3 years for all updates, additional 2 for security updates. But! after the few years the updates seems to slow down your phone…</li>
  <li>Chrome OS/Book - 5 years</li>
  <li>Windows 10 - unlimited?</li>
</ul>

<p>And remember the clocks ticks from the premier not from when you buy it!</p>

<h1 id="what-to-do-with-an-unsupported-device">What to do with an unsupported device?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Use it for some DIY project or load a custom firmware? Who does it? Less than 1% of the population?</li>
  <li>Sell it to the poorer country? What will they do with it, then?</li>
  <li>Throw it away? Wasted resources… The hardware is probably still strong enough for most of our activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole mobile industry seems to be designed against the ecology!</p>

<h1 id="what-is-my-problem">What is my problem</h1>
<p>I wanted to have a long living tablet. I have now SG Note 10 2014. A premium 5 years old not supported device… Now I regret the money. The screen is still gorgeous! It’s much better than the basic iPad 2018 9.7! Without support I can do less and less stuff with it and nothing banking related…</p>

<p>I change only my phones every 1-3 years. Tablet… why to change it so often? I don’t use it so much to it wear down.</p>

<p>I’ve checked the new Android tablets. They still got short support. Google seems to forget the Android for the tablets (no new Google tablet since many years)… in flavour to … Chrome OS, Chrome Books, 2 in 1 tablets! They still run Android apps and it is better designed for tablets and has 5 years of support!</p>

<h1 id="but-what-you-may-do-with-a-chrome-os">But what you may do with a Chrome OS?</h1>
<p>Everything popular… but it is still more a netbook than a tablet… and for me personally I do Scala software development, no JDK, IDE possible on it… Chrome OS is for cloud apps. I need some unpopular local apps.</p>

<h1 id="windows-10">Windows 10?</h1>
<p>The time support is the longest possible! Lacks in apps but I could work on it and emulate the Android games… but it’s still a Windows which needs more care to work like on Linux.</p>

<h1 id="a-very-good-solution-does-not-exist">A very good solution does not exist</h1>
<p>For now, I’ll stick with a laptop with a Linux on it… Waiting for a 16GB 4-core cheap alternative to Surface Pro (why? for better reading screen proportions and mobile screen pivot mode)</p>

<p>Do you have any thoughts or suggestions? Feel free to comment.</p>

<p>And please make a change, look for devices with long term security support.</p>
