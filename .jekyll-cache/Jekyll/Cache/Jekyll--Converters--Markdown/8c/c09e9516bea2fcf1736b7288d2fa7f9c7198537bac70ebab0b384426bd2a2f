<p>If you have multi-core x86 CPU(most of intel/amd CPUs) and windows 7+ operating system and you are not happy with your ‚Äúwork on battery time‚Äù then this may interest you.</p>

<p>On described solution, I got 60% battery savings without losing any responsiveness. The article is written for power users.</p>

<h1 id="low-time-on-battery----problem-description">Low time on battery -  problem description</h1>
<p>Needed knowledge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>x86 CPUs serve work equally to each core. Each core has the same frequency.</li>
  <li>Being responsive mean to have a prepared core for work on highest frequency. Even if you don‚Äôt have constantly full workload, your CPU would have a lot of spare processing power. This is just in case of single, short but intensive demand for CPU power. That gives you the speedy feeling.</li>
  <li>By default,all cores are active all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The implication of those is losing battery power. To avoid that, few mechanisms was introduced:</p>
<ol>
  <li>core parking. Turn off cores on low CPU usage. Turn them on when gets more ‚Äúconstant work‚Äù.</li>
  <li>frequency scaling policies. Keep frequency as low as possible. Try to keep it low and leave the responsive feel. There is no ultimate optimum. Some policies give you more ‚Äúinstant power‚Äù other saves more battery.</li>
  <li>permanent cores/CPU switch off. Realised on bios or OS level.</li>
</ol>

<p>ad. 3) it didn‚Äôt work for me at all. I think it‚Äôs a bug. Context: Thinkpad W540, windows 10</p>

<p>ad. 2) gives nice area to tune your CPU. cons: does not turn off the unused core. Still, you can have big one thread demand on which, apart from one core, all cores will do nothing and consume a lot of power.</p>

<p>ad. 1) In theory the best solution for described problem. It got very bad fame from the premiere of Windows 7. It was too aggressive and people reported lower performance in unwanted moments. That is the reason it is disabled by default. I‚Äôll give a way to use it for everyday use cases. If you have intel CPU with Skylake (or newer) architecture then you should not use my solution (because there is better for you).</p>

<p>Different setting will be attached to three different windows power plans:</p>
<ol>
  <li>power saver - big savings, big sacrifices</li>
  <li>balanced - default and the recommended plan</li>
  <li>high performance - no sacrifices, no savings</li>
</ol>

<p>We will unhide advanced settings and click through right values on GUI of power plan settings.</p>

<p>For core parking we need mainly two parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>how many cores won‚Äôt be parked - Windows name: Processor performance core parking min cores</li>
  <li>how many cores will be parked at the minimum - Windows name: Processor performance core parking max cores . This setting simulates well core disabling feature.</li>
</ul>

<p>To unhide our parameters we execute those commands:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>powercfg -attributes SUB_PROCESSOR 0cc5b647-c1df-4637-891a-dec35c318583 -ATTRIB_HIDE
powercfg -attributes SUB_PROCESSOR ea062031-0e34-4ff1-9b6d-eb1059334028 -ATTRIB_HIDE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By windows names, settings per power plans, for work on battery (in percent, for my 4 core CPU phyical core - 25%):</p>
<ul>
  <li>power saver - min cores: 25%, max cores: 25%, use when you need the biggest battery savings</li>
  <li>balanced - min cores: 25%, max cores: 50%, this should be your default power plan</li>
  <li>high performance - min cores: 100%, max cores: 0%, use to quickly overload core parking savings</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://bitsum.com/images/parking_in_power_profile_settings.png" alt="the photo of settings where you have to get" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Be aware that there are more elastic settings for core parking but I didn‚Äôt have time to get them. It should be possible to have all cores at hand, enable them on a heavy workload and disable them for most other time. It would be the best solution.</p>

<h1 id="fyi">FYI</h1>

<p>For power saver power plan I also changed scaling policy from rocket to ideal. It changes frequency much faster. In our case, when we have only one core, this is a good idea (default is very conservative). You get responsiveness on low workload (which is at most case apart from gaming and some development tasks) for the minimum price.</p>

<p>Our main problem is not valid for smartphones with ARM/Big-Little architecture since it allows to not even tasks distribution.</p>
