<h1 id="who-is-this-post-for">Who is this post for?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>your slack group is big, with a lot of busy channels</li>
  <li>you don’t react for most of the messages that aren’t direct or are with @here or @channel.</li>
  <li>you read too many messages which is counterproductive</li>
</ul>

<p>Too many notifications will make you unresponsive for what has actual value.</p>

<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>Slack got 4-ish priority levels you may set for the channel:</p>
<ol>
  <li>starred - for your obligations and stuff you love to read about</li>
  <li>normal - for stuff not very disturbing (slow source or quite important)</li>
  <li>muted - for stuff that aren’t your obligations but sometimes you need it or it is nice to grasp what is on-topic once a week/month</li>
  <li>not listed - for staff not worth even to see the name of it</li>
</ol>

<p>By using them completly you will have a clean dashboard where if something happens you won’t miss it and you won’t be distracted by unwanted productivity little killers.</p>
